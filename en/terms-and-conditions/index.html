          Unless the claims are resolved early or the schedule is extended, the
          arbitrator will issue a decision within 120 days of the initial
          pre-hearing conference. If fewer than 5 of the initial bellwether
          cases are resolved early without a final decision from the arbitrator
          (for example, through settlement), additional cases will be selected
          in groups of 10 to proceed through arbitration until at least 5 of

          attempt to facilitate resolution of the remaining claims. Once the
          mediator delivers their recommendations, the parties and the mediator
          will have 90 days—the “mediation period”—to agree on a resolution or a
          substantive methodology for resolving the remaining cases.If the
          parties are unable to reach a settlement during the mediation period,
          either party may choose to withdraw from the arbitration process and
